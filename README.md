# Title
Redacting Tool
 
# Language
Python 3.5

# Description
This tool will remove all IP address, MAC addresses, Hostnames, Domains, Usernames from various output from 
Cisco Devices. NOTE: All Cisco devices remove passwords already so no functionallity is included for this.
This script has been tested on output from multiple devices. Its suggested to manually check a little when its been run
incase any new device formatting is not found/replaced.

If you find something that is not correctly masked please let me know so that I can update the script to match it
in the future.
